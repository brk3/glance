# property-protections.conf.sample
#
# Specify regular expression for which properties will be protected in []
# For each section, specify CRUD permissions. You may refer to roles defined
# in policy.json.  An operation can be marked valid for all roles using special
# character '@', and can be restricted for all roles with special character
# '!'.
#
# The property rules will be applied in the order specified below. Once
# a match is found the remaining property rules will not be traversed through.
#
# WARNING:
# * If the reg ex specified below does not compile, then
# HTTPInternalServerErrors will be thrown. (Guide for reg ex python compiler
# used: http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax)
#
# * If an operation(create, read, update, delete) is not specified or misspelt
# then that operation for the given regex is disabled for all roles.  So,
# remember, with GREAT POWER comes GREAT RESPONSIBILITY!
